werc - a minimalist document management system
----------------------------------------------

Werc is a content management system and web framework designed to be simple to
use, simple to setup, simple to hack on, and not get on the way while allowing
users easy customization.

For more information see the official website: http://werc.cat-v.org/


Installation
------------

Requirements:

* Plan 9 from User Space - http://plan9.us
* An http server that can handle CGIs

Instructions:

Untar, configure httpd to use bin/werc.rc as a cgi-script, and create a
directory for your web site under sites/ where you can start to add content
right away. 

If your Plan 9 from User Space installation is located somewhere else than the
standard /usr/local/plan9/ you will need to edit the first line of bin/werc.rc

For general configuration options copy etc/initrc to initrc.local and customize
it as needed. Site (and directory) specific options can be set in a
sites/example.com/_werc/config file inside the site's directory. To customize
templates and included files you can store your own version of the files in
lib/ under sites/example.com/_werc/lib

For more details see the documentation section of the website:
