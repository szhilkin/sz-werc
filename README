werc - a minimalist document management system
----------------------------------------------

Werc is a DMS designed to be simple to use, simple to setup, and not get on the
way while allowing users easy customization and implement new functionality.

For more information see the official website: http://repo.cat-v.org/werc/


Installation
------------

Requirements:

* Plan 9 from User Space - http://plan9.us
* A markdown implementation is strongly recommended (although other formating systems are supported via configuration).
* An http server that can handle CGI

Instructions:

Untar, configure httpd to use bin/controller.rc as a cgi-script, and create a
directory for your web site under sites/ where you can basically start to add
content right away. For details see the documentation section of the website.

If you have a public website that uses werc I would love to hear about it and
get feedback about you experience setting it up.
