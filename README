werc - a minimalist document management system
----------------------------------------------

Werc is a CMS designed to be simple to use, simple to setup, and not get on the
way while allowing users easy customization and implement new functionality.

For more information see the official website: http://repo.cat-v.org/werc/


Installation
------------

Requirements:

* Plan 9 from User Space - http://plan9.us
* An http server that can handle CGIs

Instructions:

Untar, configure httpd to use bin/controller.rc as a cgi-script, and create a
directory for your web site under sites/ where you can start to add content
right away. 

For general configuration options copy etc/initrc to initrc.local and customize
it to your liking. Site (and directory) specific options can be set in a
_config file inside the site's directory.

For details see the documentation section of the website.
