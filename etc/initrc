# This file contains the default werc settings.
#
# DO NOT EDIT, to customize copy to etc/initrc.local and edit at will.
#
# Some settings can also be set for a specific site or directory in their
# respective _werc/config or their $masterSite/_werc/config file.

# General options

# Location of your Plan 9 from User Space installation (usually /usr/local/plan9)
plan9port=$PLAN9
#plan9port=/usr/local/plan9

# If you use 9base, it should point to your 9base root, try for example:
#plan9port=/usr/lib/9base # This is the default 9base install path in Debian.

# Path, make sure the plan9port /bin directory is included before /bin
# Keep '.' in path! It is needed.
path=($plan9port/bin . ./bin ./bin/contrib /bin /usr/bin)

# Set this to your favorite markdown formatter, eg., markdown.pl (fltr_cache
# takes as an argument a filter, in the default configuration markdown.pl, that
# caches output) Note that some werc components assume a markdown-like
# formatter, but all major functionality should should be formatter agnostic.
#formatter=(md2html.awk)
formatter=(fltr_cache markdown.pl)

# Enable debugging, to disable set to ()
debug=true

# Globally enabled apps
enabled_apps=( )

# Default site variables, must be set in initrc.local or _werc/config, only siteTitle is required.
#masterSite=cat-v.org # Not required!
#siteTitle='cat-v'
#siteSubTitle='Considered harmful'
