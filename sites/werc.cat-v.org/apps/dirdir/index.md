DirDir - A directory-oriented WikiWiki
======================================

DirDir is the next generation [diri wiki](http://repo.cat-v.org/diri/), now implemented on top of wercand
taking advantage of its user, site management frameworks and other
infrastructure.  

Features
========

DirDir is still somewhat experimental, but already all features diri had, plus some extras thanks to werc's power:

    * Hierarchical organization.
    * Markdown formatting.
    * Easily customizable templates
    * Simple and fine grained user permisions system.
    * Completely database free.
    * All needed to setup diridiri is to set a flag in your _werc/config file.
    * Automatically wiki-fy existing werc documents.
    * Implemented in about two dozen lines of rc scripts.


Status
======

Mostly usable, all basic features already implemented in the latest werc source
tree. 

About the name
==============

DirDir is a pun on diri and WikiWiki, and is also the title of a novel by science fiction and literature grand master Jack Vance.
