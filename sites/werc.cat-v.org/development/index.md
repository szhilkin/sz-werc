Werc Development
================

The latest dev code is available in the werc-dev hg repo: http://hg.cat-v.org/werc-dev/

Release Numbering
-----------------

Releases with an od 'dot-number' (eg., 1.1.x) are development releases, they are hosted in the `werc-dev` hg repo.

Releases with an even 'dot-number' (eg., 1.2.x) are stable releases, only receive bug fixes, they are hosted in the `werc` hg repo.

Major non-backwards compatible changes are only made in major release numbers (eg., 2.0).


Bug reports, feature requests, bug fixes and other patches are all very welcome, just send them to the [werc9](http://groups.google.com/group/werc9) mailing list.
