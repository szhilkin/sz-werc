Plans and ideas for the future
==============================

* Review ideas from: http://www.w3.org/TR/chips/ and http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI and see if we can do better
* Canonize and redirect all requests, we already do this for things like missing or trailing /, should do the same for /. and /./, etc. Deleting trailing . and , should make pasted urls in emails work as links.
