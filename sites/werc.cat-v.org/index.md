Werc is a minimalist web framework built on the Unix and Plan 9 *tool philosophy* of software design.

* Database free, uses files and directories instead.
* Written using the rc shell, leveraging the standard unix/plan9 command toolkit.
* Minimize tedious work: avoid having to write HTML, can use markdown instead.
* Very minimalist yet extensible codebase: 150 lines of code highly functional core, with extra functionality in modular apps.
