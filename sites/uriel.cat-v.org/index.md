"*Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they
arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.*"

                                             -- An√§is Nin

"*Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival
value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival.*"

                                             -- C.S. Lewis

"*Him that I love, I wish to be free -- even from me.*"

                                              -- Anne Morrow Lindbergh

"*The Great Man ... is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without respect and
without the fear of "opinion"; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and
"respectability", and altogether everything that is the "virtue of the herd".
If he cannot lead, he goes alone. ... He knows he is incommunicable: he finds
it tasteless to be familiar. ... When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask.
There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame.*"  

                                        -- Friedrich Nietzche, The Will to Power
