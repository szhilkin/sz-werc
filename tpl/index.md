Encyclopedia of things considered harmful
=========================================

The world is full of things that most people think are OK or even good, when in
reality are either evil or plain stupid.

This is my humble contribution to attempt to collect all all the things in the
world that bother me, if you think I'm missing anything important is missing,
please feel free to write an article about it and if I agree I will be happy to
add it to this site.

***Note:*** I just got started, there are hundreds of things I would like to cover, I will try
to add a new entry every other day or so.


The main sections for now are:

* [Software](/software/)
* [Economics](/economics/)

You can also find other items in the left sidebar.
