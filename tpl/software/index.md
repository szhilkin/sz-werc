All software sucks
==================

"*And folks, let's be honest. Sturgeon was an optimist. Way more than 90% of code is crap.*" -- Al viro

"*There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.*" -- C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture

"*One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.*" -- Ken Thompson

"*..At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I
soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be
implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a
mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million
dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way -and
that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost
simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.*" -- C.A.R. Hoare

"*It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes.*"  -- Keith Braithwaite
