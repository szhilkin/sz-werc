Subsidies considered harmful
============================

Farm subsidies are one of the most inept and outright evil economic policies ever invented, trillions of dollars are wasted every year in the world because of farm subsidies in developed countries, while driving into bankruptcy millions of farmers in third world countries.

Millions of tons of food are thrown away because of the ridiculously stupid farm policy of the US and Europe while millions die of starvation.
